# ACNH-Villager-Generator
This project uses the Animal Crossing New Horizon API. I'm receiving info on a random villager from the API, and then displaying that info on a pokemon style playing card. This is my original version of this site, which I ended up recreating to fix how it looks on different screen sizes.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
I started this project by setting up my HTML template. I then started with my JavaScript and had to check to see what data I was receiving from the API so that I could choose what I wanted to use for my card. I ended up using the name, image, birth date, catch-phrase, and saying for each villager. Then I started with the CSS for the styling, so that I could display this info on a playing card.
